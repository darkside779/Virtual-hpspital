  doctor_id INT,
  appointment_date DATE,
  appointment_time TIME,
  FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (doctor_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);

CREATE TABLE payments (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  appointment_id INT,
  payment_method VARCHAR(255),
  payment_status VARCHAR(255),
  FOREIGN KEY (appointment_id) REFERENCES appointments(id)
);

CREATE TABLE telemedicine_sessions (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  appointment_id INT,
  session_start_time DATETIME,
  session_end_time DATETIME,
  FOREIGN KEY (appointment_id) REFERENCES appointments(id)
);
PHP Code Structure

Create a PHP project with the following folders:
config (database configuration files)
controllers (PHP controllers for handling user input)
models (PHP models for interacting with the database)
views (PHP views for rendering HTML templates)
public (publicly accessible files, including the index.php file)

Features Implementation
User registration and login:
Create a UserController to handle user registration and login functionality
Use the UserModel to interact with the users table in the database
Patient profile management:
Create a PatientController to handle patient profile management functionality
Use the UserModel to interact with the users table in the database
Doctor profile management:
Create a DoctorController to handle doctor profile management functionality
Use the UserModel to interact with the users table in the database
Appointment scheduling:
Create an AppointmentController to handle appointment scheduling functionality
Use the AppointmentModel to interact with the appointments table in the database
Telemedicine functionality (video conferencing):
Integrate a video conferencing library (e.g. Zoom, Skype) into the website
Create a TelemedicineController to handle telemedicine session management functionality
Use the TelemedicineModel to interact with the telemedicine_sessions table in the database
Payment gateway integration:
Integrate a payment gateway (e.g. Stripe, PayPal) into the website
Create a PaymentController to handle payment processing functionality
Use the PaymentModel to interact with the payments table in the database
This is a high-level plan to get you started on creating a Virtual Health website using PHP and MySQL. You'll need to implement each feature and functionality in detail, using the code structure and database design outlined above.

Do you want me to elaborate on any specific feature or functionality?

Admin Database Tables

Create the following tables in the MySQL database:
admins (admin information)
admin_logs (admin activity logs)

  FOREIGN KEY (admin_id) REFERENCES admins(id)
);
Admin PHP Code Structure

Create an admin folder in the PHP project with the following subfolders:
controllers (PHP controllers for handling admin input)
models (PHP models for interacting with the admin database tables)
views (PHP views for rendering admin HTML templates)

Admin Access Control

Implement access control to restrict admin access to certain features and functionality
Use a library like php-ACL to manage access control lists (ACLs)
This is a high-level plan to get you started on creating an admin component for the Virtual Health website using PHP and MySQL. You'll need to implement each feature and functionality in detail, using the code structure and database design outlined above.
